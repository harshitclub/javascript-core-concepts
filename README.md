# JavaScript Core Concepts 🚀

This repository is a **comprehensive collection of JavaScript concepts**, explained with examples and documentation.  
It is designed as a personal knowledge base and a practical reference for developers who want to **understand JavaScript deeply**, from basics to advanced topics.

---

## 📌 Why This Repository?

JavaScript is the backbone of modern web development, both in browsers and on servers (Node.js).  
This repo covers the **most important JavaScript fundamentals, advanced concepts, and runtime behaviors** with hands-on code and explanations.

With this, you can:
- Strengthen your **core language fundamentals** (variables, types, functions).
- Master **asynchronous programming** (callbacks, promises, async/await, event loop).
- Explore **object-oriented and functional programming** in JS.
- Understand **memory management, scope, closures, and hoisting**.
- Practice **modern ES6+ features** and design patterns.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each concept is organized in its own folder with:
- Example programs (`.js` files)
- A short **README.md** explaining the concept
